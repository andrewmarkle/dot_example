  SUMMARY = %q(Keep your project's environment variables in snyc across your team.)
  DESCRIPTION = %q(Keeping the whole team's environment variables in sync can be hard. Dotenv helps authomate setting the variables but people forget to update the README telling what variables are needed and this documentation quickly gets out of date. `dot_example` automates setting up git hooks to create an example file with variable names for all ENV variables from the dotenv and checks against this list when you pull down updates to the repo. Type one command once and never have to worry about being behind on ENV variables again!)
